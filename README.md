EduTube is a simple, responsive web application that allows users to create, comment on, and watch educational videos. 

**Technology Stack**: React and Tailwind CSS.

### Key Features

- Show a list of videos and allow users to select a video from the list.
- Allow the user to create a new video object with a title, description, and a video URL.
- Enable users to comment on a video and view comments from other users.
- Open the videos in full screen with full playback functionality.
- Include options for adjusting playback speed and volume.

### Future Features/Enhancements

- Allow a user to edit videos that they have posted.
- Allow a user to sign in to comment or comment as a guest.
- Add more tests as I learn more about unit testing.
- Add more error boundaries.
- Break down components a bit more.

### Deployed Application Issue

Every time I try to deploy my web application, the API calls no longer work. I've tried to debug, but I have not been successful.
